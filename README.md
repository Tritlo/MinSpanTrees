Minimum Spanning Trees
=====================

Finding minimum spanning trees is a well known problem,
and we find them here by using Prim's algorithm.

The second part is finding the next best MST, when a
edge from the MST is removed. This is also an important
problem, such as in route finding when a route becomes
closed off.
